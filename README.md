# Olin Computing Web Site Source

This repository holds the source to the [Olin Computing web site](http://olin-computing.website/).

The web site has updated versions of the two pages at Allen Downey's [Computing at Olin Google Site](https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/home/computing-at-olin).

Both the web site and the pages are under development, and the strategy of hosting these on GitHub is an exploration.
