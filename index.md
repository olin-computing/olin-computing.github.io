This site has information about computing at the [Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/).

It has updated versions of the two pages at Allen Downey's [Computing at Olin Google Site](https://sites.google.com/site/allendowney/home/computing-at-olin).

Both the web site and the pages are under development, and the strategy of hosting these on GitHub is an exploration.

For official information, see the [Olin engineering course listing](http://www.olin.edu/course-listing/engineering/), and the
[list of Olin faculty](http://www.olin.edu/faculty/), at the [Olin College official website](http://www.olin.edu).
